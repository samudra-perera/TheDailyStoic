## HOPE AND FEAR ARE THE SAME

> “Hecato says, ‘cease to hope and you will cease to fear.’ . . . The primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting ourselves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far ahead.”

*—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 5.7b–8*

Hope is generally regarded as good. Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato (known as Hecato of Rhodes), they are the same—both are projections into the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. Both mean you’re living a life in opposition to *amor fati.*

It’s not about overcoming our fears but understanding that both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of *want* and *worry*in them. And, sadly, the want is what causes the worry.
