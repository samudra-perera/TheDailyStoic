> “For philosophy doesn’t consist in outward display, but in taking heed to what is needed and being mindful of it.”

*—MUSONIUS RUFUS, LECTURES, 16.75.15–16*

The monk dresses in his robes. A priest puts on his collar. A banker wears an expensive suit and carries a briefcase. A Stoic has no uniform and resembles no stereotype. They are not identifiable by look or by sight or by sound.

The only way to recognize them? By their character.
