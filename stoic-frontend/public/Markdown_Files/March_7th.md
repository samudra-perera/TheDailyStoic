## DON’T TRUST THE SENSES

> “Heraclitus called self-deception an awful disease and eyesight a lying sense.”

*—DIOGENES LAERTIUS, LIVES OF THE EMINENT PHILOSOPHERS, 9.7*

Self-awareness is the ability to objectively evaluate the self. It’s the ability to question our own instincts, patterns, and assumptions. *Oiêsis*, self-deception or arrogant and unchallenged opinion, requires that we hold all our opinions up to hard scrutiny; even our eyes deceive us.

On the one hand, that’s alarming. *I can’t even trust my own senses?!*Sure, you could think about it that way. Or you could take it another way: because our senses are often wrong, our emotions overly alarmed, our projections overly optimistic, we’re better off not rushing into conclusions about anything. We can take a beat with everything we do and become aware of everything that’s going on so we can make the right decision.
