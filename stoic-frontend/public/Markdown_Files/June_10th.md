## YOU CAN DO IT

> “If you find something very difficult to achieve yourself, don’t imagine it impossible—for anything possible and proper for another person can be achieved as easily by you.”

*—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.19*

There are two kinds of people in this world. The first looks at others who have accomplished things and thinks: *Why them? Why not me?* The other looks at those same people and thinks: *If they can do it, why can’t I?*

One is zero-sum and jealous (if you win, I lose). The other is non-zero-sum (there’s plenty to go around) and sees the success of others as an *inspiration.* Which attitude will propel you onward and upward? Which will drive you to bitterness and despair?

Who will you be?
