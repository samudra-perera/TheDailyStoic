## WE HAVE BUT ONE OBLIGATION

> “What is your vocation? To be a good person.”

*—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 11.5*

The Stoics believed, above all else, that our job on this earth is to be a good human being. It is a basic duty, yet we are experts at coming up with excuses for avoiding it.

To quote Belichick again: “Do your job.”
