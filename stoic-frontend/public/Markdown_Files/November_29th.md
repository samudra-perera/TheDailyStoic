## YOU’RE GOING TO BE OK

> “Don’t lament this and don’t get agitated.”

*—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.43*

There’s that feeling we get when something happens: *It’s all over**now. All is lost.* What follows are complaints and pity and misery—the impotent struggle against something that’s already occurred.

Why bother? We have no idea what the future holds. We have no idea what’s coming up around the bend. It could be more problems, or this could be the darkness before the dawn.

If we’re Stoic, there is one thing we can be sure of: whatever happens, we’re going to be OK.
